// SAVING AND LOADING A DEGREE PLAN

/* 

How it work: 
The user will be working on a degree plan which is:
    - a degree plan is a collection of semesters, and a semester is a collection of courses.
We want to allow the user to be able to:
    1) refresh page and still retain the degree plan they were working on once the page loads back up 
    2) have a save button that once the user presses will save the dataset in local storage
        - both 1 and 2 kind of tie into each other, the user must save the data in order to retain
          the degree plan. (maybe i can make this functionality better later)

Resources I can use (will update as I go along):
